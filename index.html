        <h1>Fostering is one of the best things you can do this kitten season. </h1>
        <p>When shelters get overcrowded, fostering cats or kittens is a great opportunity to
            get more involved. This frees up space and resources for shelters, allowing them to
            rescue and assist even more animals, which is particularly important during kitten
            season. It also provides a friendly environment for cats and kittens that have not
            been adopted to reside in until they can find a forever home</p>
